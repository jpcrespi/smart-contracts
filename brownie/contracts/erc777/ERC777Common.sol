/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC777} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 *
 * Support for ERC20 is included in this contract, as specified by the EIP: both
 * the ERC777 and ERC20 interfaces can be safely used when interacting with it.
 * Both {IERC777-Sent} and {IERC20-Transfer} events are emitted on token
 * movements.
 *
 * Additionally, the {IERC777-granularity} value is hard-coded to `1`, meaning that there
 * are no special restrictions in the amount of tokens that created, moved, or
 * destroyed. This makes integration with ERC20 applications seamless.
